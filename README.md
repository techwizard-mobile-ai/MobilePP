# AirVengeance

Project for CSE 442: Software Engineering 

Course focuses on engineering practices. Specifically developing in sprints and following Agile practices. 

AirVengeance is a two module Android application. 

The things module is an Android Things application built for Raspberry Pi which monitors air quality conditions and pushs
that data into a Firebase Realtime Database. 

The mobile module is an Android application that fetches data from the Firebase database and displays those values.
